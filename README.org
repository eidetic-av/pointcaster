* Building
To configure the project and build all dependencies, find the location of
vcpkg's CMake toolchain file (e.g. mine is located at
`/opt/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`) and run the following command
from the root directory:
#+begin_src fish
cmake -B build -S . -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=ports \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg.cmake
#+end_src
Building on Windows defaults to dynamic linking. We can switch to static
linking to ship a single binary if desired. Building on 'nix will always use
static linking so the project doesn't attempt to use any conflicting libraries
on the system path.
#+begin_src fish
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
#+end_src
Now that you are configured, the following command will compile the project
into the `build` directory:
#+begin_src fish
cmake --build build
#+end_src
If you are on Windows, make sure to set the Visual Studio configuration when
building:
#+begin_src fish
cmake --build build -- /p:configuration=Release
#+end_src
