#+title: Pointcaster
#+author: Matt Hughes
* Developing
+ ~pointcaster~ requires [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] and [[https://vcpkg.io][vcpkg]] to build and manage dependencies. A working CUDA toolkit installation and ~nvcc~ on the path is also required.
+ Linux builds are using GCC 12.3.0
+ Windows builds use MSVC v143
+ CUDA version 12.2.r12
** Configure
#+begin_src fish
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=$(pwd)/ports
#+end_src
*** On Linux systems with multiple versions of GCC
At least Arch is shipping with GCC 13 as default, so the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` CMake option needs to be set:
#+begin_src fish
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-12 ...
#+end_src
** Build
#+begin_src fish
cd build
cmake --build .
#+end_src
* Pipeline
** Sensor Drivers
*** Notes
+ To run multiple Azure Kinect sensors on Linux, you must boot with the following kernel parameter that adjusts memory provided to USB hosts. 
  Set it to a number appropriate for your system and camera count.
  256MB is enough (and is probably overkill):

#+begin_src
usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=256
#+end_src

** ZeroMQ
** Magnum
