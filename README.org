*** Notes
+ To run multiple Azure Kinect sensors on Linux, you must boot with the
  following kernel parameter that adjusts memory provided to USB hosts -- set
  it to any number that is appropriate for your system:
  #+begin_src
usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1024
  #+end_src
** OpenCV
** ZeroMQ
** Magnum
* Building
To configure the project and build all dependencies, find the location of
vcpkg's CMake toolchain file (e.g. mine is located at
`/opt/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`) and run the following command
from the root of this repository:
#+begin_src fish
cmake -B build -S . --toolchain /opt/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
#+end_src
Now that you are configured, the following command will compile the project
into the `build` directory:
#+begin_src fish
cmake --build build
#+end_src
If you are on Windows, make sure to set the Visual Studio configuration when
building:
#+begin_src fish
cmake --build build -- /p:configuration=Release
#+end_src
